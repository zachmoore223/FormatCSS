# Overview

* CSS has many "knobs" -- size, color, etc, ....
* We want the ability to store "good" combinations of settings and make them available as a stylesheet.
* a prototype with three different colors, simple CSS that has everything connected together
* hard coded style sheet as stylesheet 1
* (Hardcoded examples) "As a graphic designer, I need to be able to modify the colors for a given styleNumber, so my stylesheets are purchased by developers."
* Example:
    * (Hardcoded examples) "As salesperson, I need to be able to display two stylesheets with the same structure but different colors, so I can do demos and sell this investors."
      Development team: "oh, thats medium-to-small" (DONE! - Simple two css sheets setup)
    * (READONLY User) "As a website developer, I need to be able to download CSS based on styleNumber, so my site is pretty." (Done! css/# is not linkable as they're created!)
    * (WRITING User) "As a graphic designer, I need to be able to modify the colors for a given styleNumber, so my stylesheets are purchased by developers." (in process!!!)
